# Packet Flood Detection System

The Packet Flood Detection System is a Python-based tool designed to monitor network traffic and detect various types of flood attacks, including UDP, SYN, ICMP, HTTP, TCP, and DNS floods. By analyzing incoming packets, the system identifies abnormal traffic patterns and alerts the user to potential attack scenarios.
